Final Project



- For our project we decided to examine the first and last SOU speeches by
President Bush and President Obama. Our analysis will consist of taking a list
of acceptable talking points (with words associated with them) and counting
how many times they are mentioned in each speech. This will give us a sense of
the priorities each President had at the time. We will then use this data to
calculate the percentage of each talking point relative to the whole speech.
To begin our analysis, run the program enter main() in the python shell.
In our analysis we chose to examine the SOU speeches, but our countWords
function will work with any text file. Upon running the main, our analysis will
display 2 different plots comparing 

- Our countWords function will count the number of unique words in any text
file (words that aren't stop words) and will tell you the top 20 most used 
words in the text with the number of times used appearing next to them. Our
analysis will return a percentage of each topic by checking the speeches
for specified words from a list and recording the number of times mentioned.
We will then use this data to plot each President's percentage of talking 
points for their first and last SOU speeches.


- This project was very fufilling for us. It challenged us to think creatively
and expand the course material into real life examples. At first, we were
struggling to find an idea that would work best. We eventually came to
the conclusion that we wanted to analyze each presidents talking points
to show how focused they were on controversial topics. This idea sparked
creativity in both of us and we were able to write code that completed
the task in the way we wanted. It was a great and enjoyable experience.
